Assumptions: Django is installed into your virtualenv and you are currently in your virtualenv
To setup the database before use run 'python3 manage.py migrate' in a terminal 
To run the web server type 'python3 manage.py runserver'
This will start an instance of the server at port 8000 at localhost
Type 'localhost:8000' in a browser to navigate to the site, it will live update as you make changes
so no need to restart the server whenever a change is made.
