/**
 * OSD scheduler.
 * <p>This is a package-info.java file. For those new to Java, hi! The function
 * of package-info.java files is to describe what a package as a whole is.
 * Therefore, when you encounter a new package - say, any of ours! - you should
 * look for its package-info.java <em>first</em> to orient yourself. If you're
 * reading this in an online environment, just look for the package
 * documentation before diving into class-specific docs. You'll thank yourself
 * later when you don't have (as much of a) headache.</p>
 * <p>And I promise I'm not usually <em>this</em> informal in documentation!!
 * There just isn't actually anything <em>in</em> this root package, and I know
 * most of us aren't from a Java background, so it seemed like a good place to
 * introduce the doc structure.</p>
 * <p>Oh, and if you ever see something funky-looking with a -> ? That's how
 * Java expresses lambdas. I swear, they're impossible to Google if you don't
 * know that name. Sorry!! But now you know. On that note, we're using
 * <a href="https://medium.com/@isoron/a-friendly-introduction-to-dagger-2-part-1-dbdf2f3fb17b">Dagger 2</a>
 * for dependency injection, but our dependency graph is pretty simple, so
 * familiarizing yourself with the basics is plenty.</p>
