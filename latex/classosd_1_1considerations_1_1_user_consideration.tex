\subsection{Detailed Description}
Abstract base class for user preferences and constraints. User preferences and constraints are both defined as pairs of scheduling elements. For example, a constraint indicating Professor Brown can't teach block 7\-A would have one of its members be Professor Brown and the other be block 7\-A. 

What exactly this pair {\itshape means} is up to the specific implementation, however. The purpose of this class is to provide an easy way to check how many members match, not to interpret that result.
